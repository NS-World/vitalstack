# VitalStack

Source for [vitalstack.co.in](https://vitalstack.co.in/): a WordPress site hosted on Hostinger.

## Repository layout

```
wp-content/themes/vitalstack/   Custom WordPress theme (deployed to Hostinger)
content/                        Article drafts, editorial briefs, content calendar
docs/                           Audit, roadmap, editorial guidelines
```

WordPress core, plugins, uploads and the database live on Hostinger and are
**not** stored here. WordPress export files (`*.WordPress.*.xml`) contain user
emails and are git-ignored on purpose.

## Deploying the theme

1. Zip the theme folder: `cd wp-content/themes && zip -r vitalstack.zip vitalstack`
2. WordPress admin → Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload → replace current.

(Later: Hostinger Git deployment can pull this repo automatically.)
