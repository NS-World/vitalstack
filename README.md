# VitalStack

## Repository layout

WordPress core, plugins, uploads and the database live on Hostinger and are
**not** stored here. WordPress export files (`*.WordPress.*.xml`) contain user
emails and are git-ignored on purpose.

## Deploying the theme

1. Zip the theme folder: `cd wp-content/themes && zip -r vitalstack.zip vitalstack`
2. WordPress admin → Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload → replace current.

(Later: Hostinger Git deployment can pull this repo automatically.)
